# GettingCleaning
project repo for Getting and Cleaning Data course
This repo includes the following files, as specified in the course project instructions:
1. run_analysis.r. This is single R script that reads data files, selects and names features, and the summarizes data.
2. my_summaries.txt.  This is a comma-separated text file. Its first line contains feature names.  The rightmost three columns are activity name, activity code, and subject number. 
3. codebook.txt.  This is a list of the feature names. It is derived from the column names of my merged dataframe ( 'thedata'), and the means of those features as output in my_summaries.txt.  The naems for the means are simply the names of the features with '_mean' appended.
