This is the code book for my project. These are the column names for the table that
 my R script wrote to my_summaries.txt.  Each line of this table is a unique observation set, defined as 
for each of 79 features, the mean of its observations for a given actiivty done by a given subject. Here are the feature names, followed by the activity code, activity name, and subject id:

1. "1" "tBodyAcc-mean..-X_mean"
1. "2" "tBodyAcc-mean..-Y_mean"
1. "3" "tBodyAcc-mean..-Z_mean"
